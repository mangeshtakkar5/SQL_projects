WITH cte1 AS (
SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY city ORDER BY name) as rn
FROM players_location)
SELECT
MAX(CASE WHEN city = 'Bangalore' THEN name END) as Bangalore,
MAX(CASE WHEN city = 'Mumbai' THEN name END) as Mumbai,
MAX(CASE WHEN city = 'Delhi' THEN name END) as Delhi
FROM cte1
GROUP BY rn
ORDER BY rn
